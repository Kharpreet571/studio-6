    <h2>Student Privacy Laws: What District & School Administrators Need To Know</h2>
    <p>Due to the increased use of technology in schools, student data privacy has become a major concern. Education officials need to navigate complicated federal, state, and local privacy rules.</p>

        <h2>Why Should Schools Care About Data Protection?</h2>
        <p>Schools handle vast amounts of sensitive student data, exposing them to strict legal regulations. The consequences of failing to uphold these standards can be severe, as demonstrated when Lincoln College in Illinois had to shut down permanently following a ransomware attack on its data systems in 2022.</p>

                <h4>What is it?</h4>
                <p>FERPA, created in 1974 by the U.S. Department of Education, is a federal statute that gives parents and students aged 18 and above the right to examine educational records. It applies to both paper and electronic documents.</p>
