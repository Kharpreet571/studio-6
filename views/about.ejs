            <h2>BALANCING INNOVATION AND PRIVACY: A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FOR ETHICAL DATA USE IN EDUCATION</h2>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Harpreet Kaur</p>
            <p><strong>Student ID:</strong> 1000128772</p>
            
            <h3>Project Aim</h3>
            <p>This study examines the balance between utilizing data-driven technologies for educational innovation and maintaining strong ethical protections for student data privacy. The research seeks to develop and recommend a comprehensive governance framework that enables educational institutions to benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics while protecting student privacy through proactive policies, technical safeguards, and increased cultural awareness.</p>
            
            <h3>1.0 Introduction</h3>
            <p>According to Joel R. and Florian Schaub (2018), the intersection of education, Big Data, and student privacy is a complex and often contentious issue. Enhancing educational outcomes and safeguarding student privacy are both critical societal values that frequently conflict. Big Data and Learning Analytics offer insights that can transform education through extensive analyses of student interactions with educational technologies.</p>
            
            <h3>1.1 Overview of the Project</h3>
            <p>This research is a thorough examination of the crucial problem of striking a balance between student data privacy and technology innovation in contemporary educational settings. The main issue is that, although data-driven technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics (BDA) have the potential to revolutionise personalised learning and institutional efficiency, they also present serious threats to the security and privacy of sensitive student data.</p>
            
            <h3>1.2 Goals and Objectives</h3>
            <h4>Overall Goal</h4>
            <p>To examine the crucial balance between using data-driven technologies to enhance education and upholding solid, ethical student data privacy protections.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Objectives</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>To Analyze the Central Dilemma</li>
                <li>To Define the Data Privacy Landscape in Education</li>
